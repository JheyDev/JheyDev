# Hi there, I'm Jennyfer Ribeiro! 👋

### Frontend Developer | ADS Student

I am a Software Engineering student at **Uniasselvi**, currently transitioning from a background in Design and Sales to Technology. My focus is on building responsive, accessible, and intuitive web interfaces.

I combine my creative eye for **UI/UX** with logic to solve real-world problems through code. Currently deepening my knowledge in the core web technologies to build solid foundations.
